                <p>It is my great pleasure to congratulate you all for passing the SEE examination with excellent grades. As you begin to make your important choices about the +2 colleges, you have to know certain factual things of the college that you want to study in. To help you make the informed decision, we are here to share what CCRC distinctly offers as clearly as possible through this website.</p>
                <p>At CCRC, we are committed to providing high quality learning environment, where each student can explore his/her potential. We provide you with every opportunity and individual support and guidance you need during this critical state of your education to develop you academically and personally. CCRC has been the choice of many SEE/SLC toppers & bright students from the very beginning. CCRC has been able to maintain very impressive HSEB/NEB board results since its establishment. Similarly, placements of our students in the national & international colleges & Universities are outstanding. I am really proud of the exceptional track records of successes achieved by our students. The college receives a large number of applicants to get admission to +2 degree every year and only a selective number of students get admission in CCRC which is determined through the entrance examination.</p>
                <p>I look forward to knowing more about you at CCRC!</p>
